How to calibrate....

Galvo
   Galvo is implemented (but not pretty)
   Print the FSL galvo calibration file.  The order of points is different, but the sheet works.

   Start calibration for galvo:
   	 bin/gui calib.txt galvo
	 The first point is the back left, then will go to the right, then forward.
	 'N' - next point
	 'P' - previous point
	 'F' - faster, can also use '+'
	 'S' - slower, can also use '-'
	 'L' - move left
	 'R' - move right
	 'U' - move up (toward back)
	 'D' - move down (toward front)
	 ' ' - show laser for given point
	 'a' - show all laser points (note: if laser profile is setup too fast you'll see lines of travel.
	       For many prints these lines won't matter as the laser doesn't move large distances, but it does for the calib.
	 'w' - write results to a file (it will be something like galvo.txt.new), I usually extract out the point data and place it in the galvo.txt file.
	       At some point I'll try to output the file(s) in the existing format so you just rename the file without .net


   Z axis
     bin/gui calib.txt zcal
        When you run this it will find the limit sensor.  The VAT is likely between 1000 and 1200 points below the limit sensor.
        Warning: there is nothing to stop you from smashing the VAT or 'ceiling' of the printer.
       
     'u' - move up
     'd' - move down
     'h' - seek the home (this will move up 2-3 cm before moving down).
     '+' - increase distance of moves
     '-' - decrease distance of moves

     Note: this does not save the value, you'll need to copy the position value into calib.txt and edit the setting (z.belowlimit=<your value>)
