Flash a 4.4.* bone kernel
	https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-8.6-lxqt-4gb-armhf-2016-11-06-4gb.img.xz
	This will have 4.4.30, I have also run with 4.4.39
	
git clone http://github.com/doobie42/OpenPegasus

Configuring WiFi (if you have wireless):
	sudo conmanctl
	#connmanctl> tether wifi disable 
	#connmanctl> enable wifi 
	#connmanctl> scan wifi 
	#connmanctl> services 
	#connmanctl> agent on 
	#connmanctl> connect wifi_*_managed_psk 
	#connmanctl> quit 
	
Install "extra" tools required to compile.
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install scons 
	Only needed for GUI: 
		sudo apt-get install gtkmm-3.0 (this wild cards a lot of stuff that might not be needed, TBD cleanup) 
	sudo apt-get autoremove
	
Setup BBB Device Tree:
	cd OpenPegasus/dtb-rebuilder/
	sudo make
	sudo make install
	sudo vim /boot/uEnv.txt  (can you see mine for a bbb wireless in BBB_configuration)
		At this point you need to know what beaglebone you have and add one of the dtb=<> lines into the file.
			Note: only black wireless and black non-wireless are supported
			Wireless: dtb=am335x-boneblack-wireless.dtb
			Non-Wireless: dtb=am335x-boneblack.dtb
		Check to see if cape_universal=enable, if so, set it to disable
	
Update the INITRAMFS (any time you change a DTB in /boot):
	cd /opt/scripts/
	sudo git pull
	cd tools/developers/
	sudo ./update_initrd.sh
	
	
	sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/pruss-blacklist.conf to add the following:
		 
		blacklist pruss
		blacklist pruss_intc
		blacklist pru-rproc
		
Reboot

Compile OpenPegasus:
	cd OpenPegasus/mainapp
	scons
	cd hardware
	./compileLaser
		Note: there are 3 profiles I setup for the laser, they control the delay beween enabling/disable the laser and moving the galvo.  The slower will be more accurate, to change:
		cd mainapp/hardware
		rm profilegalvo.hp
		ln -s profiles/<profile>.hp profilegalvo.hp
		./compileLaser
		   default.hp - slowest
		   faster.hp  - medium
		   fastest.hp - fastest (might move laser too quickly, but will print faster)
		   
Run OpenPegasus (Right now there is no GUI, even though it is called GUI, I disabled it for the time being):
	
	bin/gui <calib file> - would bring up GUI when available
	bin/gui <calib file> z - debug tool for z axis
	bin/gui <calib file> zup  - moves the Z axis up about 2 cm
	bin/gui <calib file> galvo - galvo calibration (works OK, not perfect)
	bin/gui <calib file> zcal - z axis calibration (not implemented)
	bin/gui <calib file> <gcode file> - print gcode file


Trouble shooting:
	prussdrv_open open failed
	gui: prussdrv_open failed
	     If you get this error, it means the PRU wasn't setup/enabled properly.

	     Either modprobe uio_pruss (doesn't need reboot, but will need to be done every boot)
	     Or add "uio_pruss" to /etc/modules (recommended; needs reboot)
	      

	BBB- wireless
	     Seems to hang or lock up
	     	   Power management is likely on:
		   1) Current boot: Execute: sudo /sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off
		   2) Every boot: Create a cron job with the following 
		   	  @reboot sleep 60 && /sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off
